# Project Outline

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

Our group was interested in creating an inventory-style app to solve a problem that an organization might face, but also making the experience fun for the user via a game-ified user interface. So we came to the consensus that we'd create a project called "Tea Shop Inventory: The Game". This is an app which keeps track of the inventory of a tea shop warehouse, but users use arrow keys to navigate a forklift around obstacles (people and other forklifts) to move tea off of delivery trucks and into the correct spaces in the warehouse. We will use database CRUD operations to track the status of inventory. Weâ€™ll also pull actual tea varieties from a website or API.

### Features

1. Add items to inventory
2. Remove items from inventory
3. Search for items in inventory
4. User login

### Technologies

1. Java
2. Spring Boot
3. MySQL
4. React

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll need to learn more React for the front-end. I'll also need to learn basics of Java + how to pull from an API of tea varieties. I also don't know how to build a small game-engine, but I know that Austin said he can provide one to us that we can then modify.
